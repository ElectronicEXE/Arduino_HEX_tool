# Arduino_HEX_tool

A small batch program to help you read/write/verify from a microcontroler EEPROM or FLASH.

To use it simply run arduino_hex_tool.cmd from the AHX dir or use the latest release exe.

The hex/bin files that need to be uploaded need to be placed in the AHX folder or on the desktop if you are using the exe.
